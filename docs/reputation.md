# Reputation System

> **Status:** MVP design for transaction-backed reputation. Uptime, storage, and relay metrics will ship later as extensions once out-of-band evidence is available.

## Overview

Chiral Network tracks peer reputation through verifiable, transaction-centric evidence. Every completed on-chain transaction between two peers can produce a signed **Transaction Verdict** that is stored off-chain in the DHT. Consumers retrieve, validate, and aggregate those verdicts to rank peers for future interactions. Later releases will reuse the same storage model to incorporate additional metrics (uptime, relay quality, etc.) once the supporting evidence flow exists.

### Goals

- Provide a verifiable reputation signal without changing the on-chain protocol.
- Keep the system PoW-friendly: identities correspond to existing mining/transaction keys, and no dedicated storage nodes are required.
- Allow future metrics to plug into the same DHT namespace without breaking compatibility.

## Trust Levels

Peers are bucketed by their **transaction score**, a weighted average of verdicts retrieved from the DHT. Default weights: `good = 1.0`, `disputed = 0.5`, `bad = 0.0`. Additional decay or weighting can be applied client-side.

| Trust Level | Score Range | Description |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Trusted** | 0.8 - 1.0 | Highly reliable, consistently good performance |
| **High** | 0.6 - 0.8 | Very reliable, above-average performance |
| **Medium** | 0.4 - 0.6 | Moderately reliable, acceptable performance |
| **Low** | 0.2 - 0.4 | Less reliable, below-average performance |
| **Unknown** | 0.0 - 0.2 | New or unproven peers |

## Reputation Metrics

### Transaction Verdict Record

All transaction reputation is derived from the `TransactionVerdict` payload. Each verdict is signed by the issuer (one of the transaction parties) and stored in the DHT using the key `H(target_id || "tx-rep")`.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `target_id` | Peer ID whose reputation is updated. |
| `tx_hash` | Canonical chain reference (block + tx index or transaction hash). |
| `outcome` | `good`, `bad`, or `disputed`. |
| `details` | Optional plain-text metadata (kept ≤ 1 KB). |
| `metric` | Optional label; defaults to `transaction`. Reserved for future metrics. |
| `issued_at` | Unix timestamp in seconds when the verdict was produced. |
| `issuer_id` | Peer ID of the issuer. |
| `issuer_seq_no` | Monotonic counter per issuer to block duplicate verdicts. |
| `issuer_sig` | Signature over all previous fields using the issuer’s transaction key. |

Validation rules:
- Reject any verdict where `issuer_id == target_id`.
- Issuer may publish exactly one verdict per `(target_id, tx_hash)`.
- DHT peers keep verdicts **pending** until `tx_hash` is at least `confirmation_threshold` blocks deep (configurable, default `12`).

### Default Scoring Function

Clients aggregate retrieved verdicts using the following weighted average:

```text
score = Σ(weight(event) × value(event)) / Σ(weight(event))

value(good) = 1.0
value(disputed) = 0.5
value(bad) = 0.0
```

`weight(event)` defaults to `1.0`. Clients may optionally enable exponential time decay by configuring a `decay_window` half-life.

## Reputation Features

### Publishing Flow (DHT `STORE`)

1. **Issuer assembles verdict** once they deem a transaction final.
2. **Issuer signs payload** with their transaction key.
3. **Issuer publishes** via `DhtService::publish_reputation_verdict` (see API snippet below):
   - Key: `H(target_id || "tx-rep")`.
   - Payload: serialized `TransactionVerdict`.
4. **Receiving DHT peer**:
   - Validates the signature and ensures `issuer_seq_no` is greater than any stored value from that issuer.
  - Checks the chain through its bundled Geth node to confirm `tx_hash` exists and meets the configured confirmation depth.
  - Stores the verdict once confirmed; otherwise caches it pending until confirmation or timeout.
5. **Replication** follows the overlay’s normal rules (e.g., Kademlia `k` closest peers).

### Retrieval & Scoring (DHT `GET`)

1. **Querier computes key** `H(target_id || "tx-rep")` and issues a DHT lookup.
2. **Querier validates each verdict**:
   - Signature check using cached verifying keys.
   - Confirmation check against local Geth (drop verdicts referencing orphaned or insufficiently confirmed transactions).
   - Deduplicate by `(issuer_id, tx_hash)`.
3. **Apply scoring function** to the validated set.
4. **Cache result** locally for `cache_ttl` (default 10 minutes) to reduce repeated lookups.

### Peer Analytics

- **Score trend**: plot aggregated score vs. time.
- **Recent verdicts**: show the latest `(issuer_id, outcome, details, issued_at)`.
- **Confirmation status**: display pending verdicts awaiting sufficient confirmations.
- **Trust level distribution**: bucket peers using the default thresholds.

### Peer Selection

When downloading files, the system:

1. **Queries available seeders** from DHT
2. **Retrieves transaction scores** via the lookup flow
3. **Ranks seeders** by score, breaking ties by freshness or additional heuristics
4. **Presents top peers** in the selection modal
5. **Allows manual override** if the user prefers a different peer

### Reputation History

Each peer maintains a history of:
- **Aggregated score** over time windows
- **Recent verdicts** (default 100 per target)
- **Trust level changes**
- **Pending verdicts** still waiting on chain confirmations

## Blacklisting

Users can blacklist misbehaving peers:

### Blacklist Features

- **Manual blacklisting**: Add peer by ID from the analytics page
- **Automatic blacklisting**: System flags peers that fall below a configurable score or accumulate repeated `bad` verdicts
- **Blacklist reasons**: Document why peer was blocked
- **Timestamp tracking**: When peer was blacklisted
- **Remove from blacklist**: Unblock peers

### Blacklist Criteria

Peers may be automatically blacklisted for:
- Repeated `bad` verdicts from distinct issuers
- Publishing invalid or orphaned transactions
- Protocol violations detected elsewhere in the stack
- Excessive connection abuse (rate-limited separately)

## Privacy Considerations

### What's Tracked

- Peer IDs (not real identities)
- Transaction verdict metadata (`outcome`, optional `details`)
- Confirmation status
- Issuer identifiers for verification

### What's NOT Tracked

- File content
- Real-world identities
- IP addresses (hidden via relay/proxy if configured)
- Personal information or payment details beyond the chain reference

### Anonymous Mode

When anonymous mode is enabled:
- Reputation persists per peer key; rotating keys resets reputation
- You can still view others’ reputation provided you can reach the DHT
- IP address is masked via relay/proxy where applicable

## Implementation Notes

### DHT API Stubs

```rust
impl DhtService {
    pub async fn publish_reputation_verdict(
        &self,
        key: String,
        verdict: TransactionVerdict,
    ) -> Result<(), String> {
        // Validate locally, then send STORE request to responsible peers.
    }

    pub async fn fetch_reputation_verdicts(
        &self,
        key: String,
    ) -> Result<Vec<TransactionVerdict>, String> {
        // Issue GET, collect responses, dedupe, and return raw payloads.
    }
}
```

Library consumers should build higher-level helpers that:
- Compute the deterministic key for a `target_id`.
- Handle pending verdict caching and confirmation rechecks.
- Expose the weighted average score to UI and selection logic.

### Configuration Defaults

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `confirmation_threshold` | Blocks required beyond `tx_hash` before a verdict is accepted. | 12 |
| `confirmation_timeout` | Max duration to keep a verdict pending before dropping it. | 1 hour |
| `decay_window` | Half-life (seconds) for optional time decay. | Disabled |
| `retention_period` | How long to keep accepted verdicts before pruning. | 90 days |
| `max_verdict_size` | Maximum bytes allowed in `details`. | 1 KB |
| `cache_ttl` | Duration to cache aggregated scores locally. | 10 minutes |

## Using Reputation Data

### For Downloads

1. **Retrieve seeder scores** through the DHT lookup workflow.
2. **Prefer Trusted peers** for critical payloads.
3. **Monitor transfers** and issue a `bad` verdict if they fail.
4. **Escalate disputes** by publishing `disputed` verdicts and including relevant metadata.

### For Uploads

```typescript
import { getTransactionScore } from '$lib/services/reputation';

const score = await getTransactionScore(targetPeerId, {
  confirmationThreshold: 12,
  cacheTtl: 600_000,
});
```

1. **Complete transfers reliably** to earn positive verdicts.
2. **Publish verdicts promptly** to keep your partners’ records up to date.
3. **Monitor your own score** and investigate negative spikes.

### For Network Operations

1. **Track global score distribution** to spot suspicious clusters.
2. **Feed low-score peers** into automated blacklists or rate limiters.
3. **Tune parameters** (`confirmation_threshold`, retention) based on observed chain conditions.

## Troubleshooting

### Low Reputation Score

**Causes**:
- High proportion of `bad` verdicts
- Stale positive history outweighed by fresh negatives
- Peers disputing transactions due to unresolved issues

**Solutions**:
- Improve internet connection
- Resolve disputed transactions and request updated verdicts
- Avoid publishing verdicts until transactions are safely confirmed
- Keep application online so partners can issue follow-up positive verdicts

### Peers Not Showing Reputation

**Causes**:
- New peers (no history)
- DHT not connected
- Reputation service not initialized
- Pending verdicts waiting for confirmations

**Solutions**:
- Wait for peers to interact
- Check Network page for DHT status
- Restart application
- Verify local Geth sync height and confirmation parameters

### Reputation Not Updating

**Causes**:
- No recent transfers
- Application not running
- Backend service issue
- Cached score expired but lookup failed

**Solutions**:
- Perform some transfers
- Check console for errors
- Restart application
- Drop local cache or increase `cache_ttl`
