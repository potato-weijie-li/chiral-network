# Mining Persistence - Before & After

## Problem Statement

**Issue:** Users lose their mining progress when the browser is closed or the page is refreshed.

### Before Implementation ❌

**Scenario 1: Browser Close**
```
User: Starts mining with 4 threads
User: Mines for 2 hours, finds 5 blocks, earns 10 Chiral
User: Closes browser tab
User: Reopens app
Result: ❌ All progress lost
  - Mining shows as not started
  - Total rewards: 0
  - Blocks found: 0
  - Recent blocks: empty
  - Session time: 0h 0m 0s
```

**Scenario 2: Page Navigation**
```
User: Mining actively with stats showing
User: Navigates to Settings page
User: Navigates back to Mining page
Result: ⚠️ Mining state lost (even though backend may still be mining)
  - UI shows conflicting state
  - Session time resets
  - History charts clear
```

**Scenario 3: Accidental Refresh**
```
User: Has mined 3 blocks (6 Chiral rewards)
User: Accidentally presses F5 or Cmd+R
Result: ❌ All statistics lost
  - No record of earned rewards
  - Recent blocks list cleared
  - Mining history wiped
```

## Solution ✅

### After Implementation

**Scenario 1: Browser Close**
```
User: Starts mining with 4 threads
User: Mines for 2 hours, finds 5 blocks, earns 10 Chiral
User: Closes browser tab
User: Reopens app (even days later)
Result: ✅ All progress restored
  - Mining shows as active
  - Total rewards: 10 Chiral
  - Blocks found: 5
  - Recent blocks: all 5 blocks listed with timestamps
  - Session time: Continues from 2h 0m 0s
  - Hash rate tracking resumes
```

**Scenario 2: Page Navigation**
```
User: Mining actively with stats showing
User: Navigates to Settings page
User: Changes some settings
User: Navigates back to Mining page
Result: ✅ Full state preserved
  - Mining shows active
  - All stats intact
  - Session uptime continues
  - Charts show full history
  - No state conflicts
```

**Scenario 3: Accidental Refresh**
```
User: Has mined 3 blocks (6 Chiral rewards)
User: Accidentally presses F5 or Cmd+R
Result: ✅ Everything restored instantly
  - Total rewards: 6 Chiral still shown
  - Recent blocks: All 3 blocks preserved
  - Mining continues seamlessly
  - History charts intact
  - Session timer continues from where it was
```

**Scenario 4: Crash Recovery**
```
System: Browser crashes unexpectedly
User: Restarts browser and opens app
Result: ✅ Recovers from crash
  - Mining session restored to pre-crash state
  - All earned rewards preserved
  - Block history maintained
  - Mining can resume if backend is still running
```

**Scenario 5: Multi-Day Mining**
```
Day 1: User starts mining, earns 20 Chiral, finds 10 blocks
Day 1 Evening: User closes laptop
Day 2 Morning: User opens laptop and starts app
Result: ✅ Complete history available
  - Total rewards: 20 Chiral
  - Blocks found: 10
  - Recent blocks: All preserved with timestamps
  - Can see when each block was mined
  - Mining can be resumed
```

## Technical Implementation

### Automatic Behavior

**On Every State Change:**
```javascript
// User mines a block
miningState.update(state => ({
  ...state,
  blocksFound: state.blocksFound + 1,
  totalRewards: state.totalRewards + 2
}))
// → Automatically saved to localStorage
```

**On App Start:**
```javascript
// App initializes
const miningState = writable(loadMiningState())
// → Automatically loads from localStorage
```

**On Mining Page Mount:**
```javascript
// Mining.svelte onMount()
if ($miningState.isMining) {
  // Restore session
  sessionStartTime = $miningState.sessionStartTime
  startUptimeTimer()
  updateMiningStats()
}
// → Seamlessly resumes mining
```

**On Logout:**
```javascript
// Account.svelte handleLogout()
miningState.set({ /* reset to defaults */ })
localStorage.removeItem('miningSession')
// → Clean slate for next user
```

## User Benefits

1. **Peace of Mind**: Never lose mining progress
2. **Flexibility**: Close browser anytime without worry
3. **Transparency**: Full history of blocks mined
4. **Reliability**: Crash recovery built-in
5. **Convenience**: No manual save/restore needed

---

## Storage Details

**localStorage Key:** `'miningSession'`

**Storage Size:** ~5-20KB depending on:
- Number of recent blocks (up to 50)
- Mining history data points (up to 30)

**Example Stored Data:**
```json
{
  "isMining": true,
  "hashRate": "350 KH/s",
  "totalRewards": 10,
  "blocksFound": 5,
  "activeThreads": 4,
  "minerIntensity": 75,
  "selectedPool": "solo",
  "sessionStartTime": 1704067200000,
  "recentBlocks": [
    {
      "id": "block-1",
      "hash": "0xabc123...",
      "reward": 2,
      "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
      "difficulty": 1000000,
      "nonce": 12345
    }
  ],
  "miningHistory": [
    {
      "timestamp": 1704067200000,
      "hashRate": 350000,
      "power": 60
    }
  ]
}
```

## Browser Compatibility

✅ Chrome/Edge (Chromium)  
✅ Firefox  
✅ Safari  
✅ Opera  
✅ Brave  

**Requirement:** Browser must support localStorage (all modern browsers do)

---

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Only**: Data stored only in user's browser (not sent to servers)
- **No Passwords**: No sensitive credentials stored
- **User Control**: Cleared on logout
- **No Tracking**: No analytics or third-party access
- **Secure**: No XSS vulnerabilities (validated by CodeQL)

---

## Limitations

1. **Browser-Specific**: State not shared across different browsers
2. **Device-Specific**: Not synced across devices
3. **Storage Quota**: Subject to browser's localStorage limits (~5-10MB)
4. **Incognito Mode**: Cleared when private session ends

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Cloud sync for multi-device support
- [ ] Export/import mining session data
- [ ] Compression for larger datasets
- [ ] State versioning for app upgrades
- [ ] Backup to file system

---

## Conclusion

Mining persistence transforms the user experience from fragile and frustrating to reliable and convenient. Users can now:
- **Mine with confidence** - knowing their progress is safe
- **Use the app naturally** - no special considerations needed
- **Track their history** - complete record of mining activity
- **Recover from issues** - crashes or accidental closes

**Zero configuration required. It just works.** ✨
