# Chiral Network - Decentralized P2P File Sharing Platform

## Overview

Chiral Network is a decentralized peer-to-peer file storage and sharing system that combines blockchain technology with distributed hash table (DHT) based file storage. The system creates a separate Ethereum-compatible blockchain network with custom parameters for handling transactions while using a DHT-based approach similar to IPFS for completely decentralized file storage and retrieval without any centralized market servers.

## Design Philosophy

This implementation synthesizes concepts from multiple design teams, focusing on legitimate use cases for distributed storage:

### Core Architecture Choices

- **libp2p Protocol Stack**: Industry-standard P2P networking with NAT traversal and peer discovery
- **Hybrid Node Architecture**: Supporting provider, consumer, proxy, and relay node types
- **Proof-of-Storage Consensus**: Nodes validate storage claims through periodic challenges

### Network Model

## Running Standalone Nodes

Chiral Network supports running standalone nodes (e.g., bootstrap nodes, storage servers) without building the frontend application. This is ideal for:

- **Bootstrap Nodes**: Public nodes that help new peers join the network
- **Dedicated Storage Nodes**: Servers providing storage capacity 24/7
- **Relay Nodes**: Nodes that help with NAT traversal and peer connectivity

### Building the Standalone Node

The standalone node is in the `node/` directory and can be built independently:

```bash
cd node
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be at `node/target/release/chiral-node`.

### Running a Bootstrap Node

Use the provided script:

```bash
./run-bootstrap.sh
```

Or run the binary directly:

```bash
cd node
./target/release/chiral-node --is-bootstrap --dht-port 4001
```

### Command Line Options

```
Options:
  --dht-port <PORT>                 DHT port to listen on (default: 4001)
  --bootstrap <MULTIADDR>           Bootstrap nodes to connect to (repeatable)
  --enable-geth                     Enable geth blockchain node
  --geth-data-dir <PATH>           Geth data directory
  --miner-address <ADDRESS>         Ethereum miner address
  --log-level <LEVEL>              Log level: trace, debug, info, warn, error
  --show-multiaddr                  Show multiaddr for other nodes to connect
  --secret <SECRET>                 Generate consistent peer ID
  --is-bootstrap                    Run in bootstrap mode
  --disable-autonat                 Disable AutoNAT reachability probes
  --autonat-probe-interval <SECS>   AutoNAT probe interval (default: 30)
  --autonat-server <MULTIADDR>      Additional AutoNAT servers
  --show-reachability               Print reachability snapshot
  --show-dcutr                      Print DCUtR hole-punching metrics
  --socks5-proxy <HOST:PORT>        SOCKS5 proxy address
  --show-downloads                  Print download metrics
```

### Example: Running a Bootstrap Node

```bash
# Simple bootstrap node on default port
./node/target/release/chiral-node --is-bootstrap

# Bootstrap node with custom port and logging
./node/target/release/chiral-node \
  --is-bootstrap \
  --dht-port 4001 \
  --log-level info \
  --show-multiaddr \
  --show-reachability

# Storage node connecting to bootstrap nodes
./node/target/release/chiral-node \
  --dht-port 4002 \
  --bootstrap /ip4/YOUR_BOOTSTRAP_IP/tcp/4001/p2p/PEER_ID \
  --log-level info
```

## Disclaimer

Chiral Network is designed for legitimate file storage and sharing. Users are responsible for ensuring they have the rights to share any content they upload. The platform uses a fully decentralized architecture without centralized market servers to ensure true peer-to-peer operation and prevent commercial misuse or piracy.
