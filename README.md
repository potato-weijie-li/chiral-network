# Chiral Network - Decentralized P2P File Sharing Platform

## Overview

Chiral Network is a decentralized peer-to-peer file storage and sharing system that combines blockchain technology with distributed hash table (DHT) based file storage. The system creates a separate Ethereum-compatible blockchain network with custom parameters for handling transactions while using a DHT-based approach similar to IPFS for completely decentralized file storage and retrieval without any centralized market servers.

```bash
# Build the standalone node binary
cd src-tauri
cargo build --release --bin chiral-network-node

# Run a bootstrap node
./target/release/chiral-network-node --is-bootstrap --dht-port 4001

# Or use the convenience script
cd ..
./run-bootstrap.sh --port 4001 --log-level info
```

**Key benefits:**
- No frontend build required
- Faster compilation time
- Lower resource usage
- Suitable for server deployments

**Available options:**
- `--dht-port`: DHT listening port (default: 4001)
- `--is-bootstrap`: Run as a bootstrap node
